# Healthcare_Analytics_on_GCP_Using_PySpark


Overview
Our project is dedicated to efficiently managing and analyzing healthcare data, providing valuable insights into prescribing patterns, city-level healthcare statistics, and more. With a focus on the U.S. healthcare domain, our goal is to empower healthcare providers and organizations with data-driven decision-making tools.

Project Objectives
Data Collection and Integration: We have gathered and integrated diverse healthcare datasets, including prescribing data from 1,329,329 healthcare providers and information on 5,000 cities. This comprehensive dataset forms the foundation of our analytics platform.

Data Storage Strategy: Our project incorporates a sophisticated data storage strategy. We utilize a combination of relational databases, cloud-based storage solutions, and the power of Hive for data persistence to ensure efficient, secure, and scalable data storage.

Data Processing and Transformation: We implement data processing and transformation pipelines to clean, validate, and preprocess the data. This step is crucial for ensuring data quality and consistency.

Analytics and Reporting: Our platform offers powerful analytics capabilities. Users can explore prescribing patterns, healthcare provider insights, and city-level statistics through interactive dashboards and reports. This empowers healthcare professionals and policymakers to make informed decisions.

Data Security: Data security is a paramount concern. We employ encryption, access controls, and auditing to protect sensitive healthcare information and maintain compliance with data privacy regulations.

Data Lifecycle Management: We implement a well-defined data lifecycle management strategy. This covers data ingestion, archiving, and eventual data purging, ensuring that data is managed efficiently throughout its lifecycle.

Backup and Recovery: To safeguard against data loss, we have robust backup and recovery mechanisms in place. These ensure business continuity and data integrity.

Monitoring and Optimization: Our project continually monitors system performance and optimizes resources. This proactive approach helps maintain data availability and performance.

Impact
Our data management and analytics project have the potential to revolutionize healthcare decision-making. By providing healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers with easy access to comprehensive healthcare data, we enable them to:

Identify prescribing trends and patterns among healthcare providers.
Gain insights into the healthcare landscape at the city level.
Make data-driven decisions to improve patient care and public health.
Ensure compliance with data security and privacy standards.
Enhance data management efficiency and reduce operational costs.
Comprehensive Data Pipeline
Designed and executed a comprehensive data pipeline covering data ingestion, preprocessing, transformation, storage, and cloud integration. Ensured data quality through automated error handling, robust logging, and rigorous validation. Additionally, employed KornShell (ksh) scripts for automating the pipeline orchestration and to execute files in a precise sequence.

Conclusion
Our project represents a significant step forward in harnessing the power of data for the healthcare industry. With a robust data storage and analytics infrastructure in place, we are well-equipped to unlock valuable insights and drive positive changes in healthcare delivery and decision-making.
